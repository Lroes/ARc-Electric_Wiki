# Who are the creators of ARc-Light?

ARc-Light was designed and developed as a capstone project by a team of four students from Conestoga College in the Software Engineering Technology 
program. None of us are allowed to talk to strangers on the internet, but this page might be updated at a later date with some contact information.
