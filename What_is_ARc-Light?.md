# What is ARc-Light?

ARc-Light is an Augmented Reality Mobile Application that simulates realistic indoor lighting in AR. Using ARc-Light, users can place different lighting fixtures in AR, and have them simulate casting light. This page will try and show what ARc-Light is all about, and how it can be useful to users.

### What can it do?
Using the device's camera, ARclight detects flat planes in a room, like the floor, ceiling, and walls. Once a plane has been detected, the user can place a light fixture on the wall, ceiling, or floor. The light fixture objects are created using 3D models and Shaders. ARc-Light currently includes several different light fixtures, suitable for floors, ceilings, or walls. The user can place multiple lights, and adjust each light's position, brightness, colour, and orientation. When the user is satisfied with their light set-up, they can save and share their room by taking a screenshot, which will hide all the buttons and menus for a better view.
