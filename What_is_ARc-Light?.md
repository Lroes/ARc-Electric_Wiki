# What is ARc-Light?

ARc-Light is an Augmented Reality Mobile Application that simulates realistic indoor lighting in AR. Using ARc-Light, users can place different lighting fixtures in AR, and have them simulate casting light. This page will try and show what ARc-Light is all about, and how it can be useful to users.

Using the device's camera, ARclight detects flat planes in a room, like the floor, ceiling, and walls.
