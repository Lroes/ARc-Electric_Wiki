# What is ARc-Light?

ARc-Light is an Augmented Reality Mobile Application that creates realistic indoor lighting in AR. Using ARc-Light, users can place different lighting fixtures in AR, and have them simulate casting light. This is meant to be useful for electricians, interior designers, or even just diy renovators.
