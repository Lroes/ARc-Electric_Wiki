# What is ARc-Light?

ARc-Light is an Augmented Reality Mobile Application that creates realistic indoor lighting in AR. Using ARc-Light, users can place different lighting fixtures in AR, and have them simulate casting light. This is meant to be useful for electricians, interior designers, or even just diy renovators. This page will try and show what ARc-Light is all about, and how it can be useful to users.
