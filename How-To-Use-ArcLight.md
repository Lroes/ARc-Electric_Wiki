# How to use ARc-Light

This page will walk through the UI and operation of the ARc-Light application, and give in-depth tutorials on each feature.


### Open ARc-Light
To open ARc-Light, tap on the ARc-Light application on your phone. If it is your first time, you may need to allow the application access to your camera. This allows ARc-Light to use your devices camera to scan the room and detect planes, allowing you to place lights.

### Choose a light
To chooses a light, tap on the top left menu button. A pop-up menu will appear, allowing you to choose between floor, ceiling, and wall light fixtures. After selecting the type of light, another menu will allow you to choose between a variety of the type of lights you selected. After tapping on a light from the menu, it has been selected and can be placed.

### Place a light
To place a light, slowly move your device around until the camera detects a plane. When a plane is detected it will be indicated by a grid of white dots on the screen.

## Individual Light Settings
There are several different ways to adjust individual lights. In order to adjust a light, double tap on it. A radial menu will appear around the light.

### Turn Light On/Off
Inside the radial menu, tap on the "crossed-out lightbulb" icon. This will toggle the light on or off. If the light is toggled off, it will not cast light.

### Adjust Camera Bloom and Ambient Occlusion
Inside the radial menu, tap on the "video settings" icon. This will allow you to adjust the camera bloom and ambient occlusion around the light. Camera Bloom is a shader effect that helps with the illusion that a light is glowing. Ambient Occlusion is a shader effect used to create more realistic light and shadows. (Both of these settings are quite subtle in ARc-Light, and you will likely see very little difference when adjusting them.)

### Flip Light upside down
Inside the radial menu, tap on the icon that shows two triangles mirroring each other. This will instantly flip the light 180 degrees. This is useful if a light you have placed is in the opposite orientation of what you want it to be.
