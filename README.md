<p align="center"> This repo contains information on the ARc-Light application and was made for anyone interested in learning about the project. It functions as a wiki, and is meant to showcase the project in a more non-technical, user-friendly way. Users who desire a more technical overview of the system, are encouraged to examine the software requirements specifications at the bottom. We hope that this wiki will help make the ARc-Light application a bit more tangible and fully-realized, and we hope that you the reader will find it an interesting and informative project in the world of Augmented Reality.

## :bulb:	About ARc-Light 
ARc-Light is an Augmented Reality Mobile Application that simulates realistic indoor lighting in AR. Using ARc-Light, users can place different lighting fixtures in AR, and have them simulate casting light. This page will try and show what ARc-Light is all about, and how it can be useful to users.

What can it do?
Using the device's camera, ARc-Light detects flat planes in a room, like the floor, ceiling, and walls. Once a plane has been detected, the user can place a light fixture on the wall, ceiling, or floor. The light fixture objects are created using 3D models and shaders. ARc-Light currently includes several different light fixtures, suitable for floors, ceilings, or walls. The user can place multiple lights, and adjust each light's position, brightness, colour, and orientation. When the user is satisfied with their light set-up, they can save and share their room by taking a screenshot, which will hide all the buttons and menus for a better view.

Who is it for?
We think that ARc-Light is for everyone! Especially in this time of social distancing and staying home, we hope that anyone can have some fun virtually messing around with their interior lighting. We also believe that ARc-Light has potential as a useful tool for electricians and interior designers. Being able to visualize where light fixtures will go will save time and improve client communication and satisfaction.
